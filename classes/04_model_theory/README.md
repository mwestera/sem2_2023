### Topics:
- We cover some formal background (set theory, models) and their relation to logic and semantics

----

### Preparation (do this before class; around 30 minutes)

1. **tbd.** tbd.

-----

### Postparation (do this after class; around 3 hours)

1. **Chapter 3.** Read chapter 13 about modeling compositionality.
2. **Set theory exercises.** tbd
3. **Functions and relations.** tbd
4. **Lambda abstraction.** Read section 15.6 in the textbook, about lamdas. Give English paraphrases for the following formulas:
   1. tbd.
   2. tbd.
   3. tbd.
   4. tbd.
5. **Function application.** Simplify the following formulas, if possible, by satisfying each lambda-function with its argument (if any). If the formula cannot be simplified, indicate this.
   1. tbd
   2. tbd
   3. tbd
   4. tbd
6. **Lambdas and quantifier raising.** Try to remember, with the help of your class notes if necessary, the role lambdas played in quantifier raising as discussed in Semantics 1.
7. **tbd _([üì© submit by 03-03-2023](tbd.url))_.** tbd.
