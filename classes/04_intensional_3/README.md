## üèõ Class 4 (28-02-2023): Intensional semantics (3/3)

### Topics:
- Finalizing our intensional semantic fragment... 
- ...with special focus on set theory, models, type theory, logic and their relations.
- Discussing the paper from week 2.

----

### Preparation (do this before class; around 20 minutes)

1. **Review your week 2 submission.** Please take a moment to review your own submitted assignment about the de-re/de-dicto paper! Looking back, does it adequately address that week's assignment? Does it help you remember the crucial parts of the paper? Do you see room for improvement?

-----

## Class notes


### 1. Lexical entries (and models) for propositional attitude verbs 


### 2. Finally: a possible derivation of de-re/de-dicto ambiguity


### 3. Reflections on 'indirect interpretation', logic, and models



### 4. The paper you studied


### 5. Open questions

### Postparation (do this after class; around 3 hours)

1. **Indirect interpretation.** In your own words, explain the method of 'indirect interpretation' in semantics. Make sure to use the terms meta-language and object-language, explain the role of models, and identify possible (dis)adantages of using logic as an intermediary in modeling natural language semantics. 
2. **Quantifier raising for de-re/de-dicto.** From memory, write out the formal, compositional derivation of the _two_ translations predicted for the sentence 'Mary believes a student sleeps'.
2. **Set theory exercises.** tbd
3. **Functions and relations.** tbd
4. **Lambda abstraction.** Read section 15.6 in the textbook, about lamdas. Give English paraphrases for the following formulas:
   1. tbd.
   2. tbd.
   3. tbd.
   4. tbd.
5. **Function application.** Simplify the following formulas, if possible, by satisfying each lambda-function with its argument (if any). If the formula cannot be simplified, indicate this.
   1. tbd
   2. tbd
   3. tbd
   4. tbd
6. **Lambdas and quantifier raising.** Try to remember, with the help of your class notes if necessary, the role lambdas played in quantifier raising as discussed in Semantics 1.
7. **De-re/de-dicto reflection _([üì© submit by 03-03-2023](https://tbd.url))_.** tbd.  [Feedbackfruits maybe?]
