## 🏛 Class 4 (28-02-2023): Intensional semantics (3/3)

### Topics:
- Finalizing our intensional semantic fragment... 
- ...with special focus on set theory, models, type theory, logic and their relations.

### Preparation (do this before class; around 30 minutes)

1. **tbd.** tbd.

### Class notes


### 2. The derivation of de-re/de-dicto ambiguity

>
> - The Governor still believes in Santa Claus.
> - Ponce de León hoped to find the fountain of youth.
> 
> [...]
> Frege pointed out that when we substitute one co-referential expression for another in the complement clause of a propositional attitude verb, the truth value  of the sentence as a whole can be affected.
> 
> - Mary does not know [that Samuel Clemens is Mark Twain].
> - ? Mary does not know [that Samuel Clemens is Samuel Clemens].

Main take-away: expressions like believe, hope, seek should have access to the _intensions_ of their complements.

> - The Dean believes that I am collaborating with a famous linguist.

De-re/de-dicto: the de-dicto reading seems to involve the _intension_ of 'a famous linguist', de-re is about its _extension_.


#### Derivation with propositional attitude verb 'believe'

Susie believes John sleeps.

### Postparation (do this after class; around 3 hours)

1. **Logic exercises** tbd.
2. **Set theory exercises.** tbd
3. **Functions and relations.** tbd
4. **Lambda abstraction.** Read section 15.6 in the textbook, about lamdas. Give English paraphrases for the following formulas:
   1. tbd.
   2. tbd.
   3. tbd.
   4. tbd.
5. **Function application.** Simplify the following formulas, if possible, by satisfying each lambda-function with its argument (if any). If the formula cannot be simplified, indicate this.
   1. tbd
   2. tbd
   3. tbd
   4. tbd
6. **Lambdas and quantifier raising.** Try to remember, with the help of your class notes if necessary, the role lambdas played in quantifier raising as discussed in Semantics 1.
7. **De-re/de-dicto reflection _([📩 submit by 03-03-2023](https://tbd.url))_.** tbd.
