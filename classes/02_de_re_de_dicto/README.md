## üèõ Class 2 (14-02-2023): De-re and de-dicto ambiguity (1/2)

### Topics:
- De-re, de-dicto ambiguity.
- Could it be a scope ambiguity?

----

### Preparation (do this before class; around 30 minutes)

1. **De-re/de-dicto.** Explain in your own words, with the help of an example, what the de-re/de-dicto ambiguity is. If necessary, review section 12.5 in the textbook from last week's 'postparation'.

-----

### Postparation (do this after class; around 3 hours)

1. **Class summary.** Try to summarize, from memory and with the help of your class notes, what we discussed in class. What is the (possible) relation between de-re/de-dicto ambiguity and quantifier scope?
2. **Evidence.** Suppose the mechanism responsible for quantifier scope ambiguity is quantifier raising -- a form of (covert) movement. Given what you know about movement on the syntax side, what would constitute evidence for a quantifier scope analysis of the de-re/de-dicto ambiguity? And what would constitute evidence against?
3. **Referential and quantificational indefinites.** Study the classic paper [Fodor and Sag 1982](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25001100) sections 1-3. In case you cannot access the link, I have uploaded the PDF to Brightspace.
4. **Linguistic examples.** For each of the linguistic examples in the paper, write down what the authors intend it to demonstrate. In each case, do you believe the example is convincing in this regard?
5. **Summary of the paper _([üì© submit by 17-02-2023](tbd.url))_.** Write a careful summary of the paper (sections 1-3), of 10 medium-sized sentences. A good summary should make clear what the author's aim is for the paper (what the authors aim to demonstrate) and what their core observations and arguments are.
