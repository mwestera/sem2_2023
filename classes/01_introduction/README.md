  - Questions always welcome in the forum, break or office hours please.
- Brainstorming about some hot topics in semantics

### Class notes

#### Quantifiers

(summary of part of Semantics 1)

Core idea: Type mismatch --> something funky may be going on (quantifier raising)
  Side effect: we get different scope readings :)


#### Propositional attitudes

- Ann believes the Earth is flat.
- Ann believes the sun will explode tomorrow.

Core idea: 
1. believe needs to have access to the sense, not only the denotation
   (because I can believe one thing, and not another thing, even if both are true)
2. type mismatch --> something funky may be going on (shifting from denotation to sense)

### Preparation (do this before class; around 10 minutes)

1. Refresh your memories of [Semantics 1](https://github.com/mwestera/sem1_2023). What were some of the core concepts you learned about?

-----

### Postparation (do this after class; around 4 hours)

1. **Compositionality.** Before reading the textbook, try to define the (semantically relevant) notion of _compositionality_ in your own terms. In a later exercise below (to be submitted) you will refine it.
2. **Rules of composition.** Do you remember some composition rules we formulated in class during the course Semantics 1? If not, look back through your notes if necessary.
3. **Read Ch.12: How meanings are composed.** Read and study the chapter closely.
4. **Substitutivity:** ‚≠ê What is 'substitutivity', and what is its relation to compositionality? In relation to this, try your utmost to understand each of the linguistic examples in Section 12.3.
5. **Compositionality of senses and of denotations.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê In section 12.3 the author mentions that (according to Frege) compositionality exists both at the denotation-level and at the sense-level. At what level did our compositional rules so far reside? From Semantics 1 (and Chapter 2, section 4) you may remember that the _sense_ of a word, together with facts about the world, determines its _denotation_. Explain how it follows from this that we _don't_ need to specify composition rules at the level of denotations; composition rules at the sense level should suffice...
6. **Propositional attitude verbs.** What are propositional attitude verbs, and why do they seem to pose a problem for a compositional semantics? What was Frege's solution, as summarized in section 12.4? 
7. **Type mismatch.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Refresh your memories from Semantics 1, where we saw that the operation of Quantifier Raising was triggered by a _type mismatch_: the verb did not receive the right type of direct object its lexical entry required (namely a quantifier instead of a basic entity). Frege's solution to propositional attitude verbs assumes a special kind of operation which, while very different from quantifier raising, could likewise be triggered by some kind of type mismatch. What would this type mismatch consist in, in the case of propositional attitude verbs? Try to define (informally, or formally with lambdas) the lexical entry of a propositional attitude verb, and explain how the kind of operation proposed by Frege resolves this type mismatch.
8. **Definition and status of compositionality_([üì© submit by 10-02-2023](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/d2l/le/lessons/210127/topics/2292943))_.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Try to define in your own terms the notion _compositionality_, in the sense relevant to semantics. Make sure your definition answers questions such as: Which types of things _have_ compositionality? Is it best conceived of as a _property_ of one type of thing, or as a _relation_ between two types of things? Do we know for a fact that these things have compositionality, or is it a hypothesis, or something else? If the former, how do we know? If the latter, what would constitute evidence in favor or against this hypothesis? [Max. 10 medium sentences]
9. **Exercise A in the book.** Do 'discussion exercise' A in the book. Which concept(s) of the chapter is the (in)validity of this inference supposed to illustrate?
