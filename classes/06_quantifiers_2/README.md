## 🏛 Class 6 (14-03-2023): Quantifiers (2/3)

### Topics:
- Primary literature: acquisition of quantifiers 

----

### Preparation (do this before class; around 30 minutes)

1. **Quantifier scope recap.** It might be useful to brush up your predicate logic before class. For each of the following pairs of formulae, does one entail the other? And the other the one?
   1. ∀x ∃y [KISS(x, y)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∃y ∀x [KISS(x, y)]
   2. ∀x ∀y [KISS(x, y)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∃y ∀x [KISS(x, y)]
   3. ∃x ∃y [KISS(x, y)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∃y ∃x [KISS(x, y)]
   4. ∃x ∃y [KISS(x, y)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∃x ∃z [KISS(x, z)]
   5. ∀x [STUDENT(x) → SLEEP(x)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∀x [STUDENT(x) ∧ SLEEP(x)] 
   6. ∀x [STUDENT(x) ∨ SLEEP(x)] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ∀x [STUDENT(x)] ∨ ∀x [SLEEP(x)]
